Javascript is a programming language that allows you to create functions to give your webpage a more dynamic edge. If HTML is the skeleton, and CSS is the 
skin, then I would probably consider JavaScript to be the brain..in a sense. It gives you the ability to allow your webpage to actually do something. So for 
example if you are on facebook and you click the login button on the page, Javascript or perhaps a different language is what allows the next rendered page or
the change in interaction to happen. There is more than likely multiple lines of code that same in some other syntax, "when user click login button", "do x" 
and this allows your webpage to open up a whole new window of possibilities. Javascript allows you to assign different variables or make declaratons using
"var","let", or "const". With these you can create different different functions that will obey your every command as long as you are ready and willing to debug.
This language takes a specific syntax like alot of other languages such as Python or C++. one you understand the syntax most of the concepts are the same so if
you need a for loop, just learn the appropriate syntax for that language and you're good to go.

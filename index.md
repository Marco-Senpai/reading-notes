### Let the Sheets Cascade With Style ###
 
If HTML is the skeletal structure for a webpage then CSS is undoubtedly the skin of said body. It allows you to style your webpage by altering the background colors, padding, font and many other things. The limits of how you can change the way your webpage's appearance is within your hands completely. CSS uses curly braces to contain its lines of code. Within these curly braces you use declarations which are property and value pairs. The property specifies the element that is being selected and then a value is given to that property. The property will be before the colon, and the value will be listed after the colon. An example of a property would be the background-color property and its value could be the color red.

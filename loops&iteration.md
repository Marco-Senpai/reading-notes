# Loops and Iteration #
### So my understanding of for loops and while loops is pretty limited. The for loops make a bit more sense to me I think because I've used them more often previously. The For loops basicailly lets you initailize the variable at 0 and then iterate through the list or array of numbers or strings and then the loop terminates. The way the loop iterates is up to you. For instance you can have a a list of numbers and have the iteration only for positive numbers in that list of numbers. You can also have those numbers compared to each other to see if they are equal, larger, or smaller than each other.The while loops are a little more confusing to me. They essentially will do one thing while this current thing is true. The seconds that statment is no longer true the loop will terminate. The main take away was to avoid infinite loops at all costs to avoid your program crashing. ###
